# @type-schema/json-schema

Full TypeScript typed collection of JSON Schema drafts (per https://json-schema.org spec). 
Also includes `Ts-Extras` meta draft & types, which extends JSON-Schema to fully express TypeScript types in JSON.

## Notes

This code is built for use with the @type-schema suite but is maintained separately in order to serve in any TypeScript project
which requires JSON Schema typing.

It will be maintained and kept current as new JSON Schema drafts are published.

## Pre-release Disclaimer

Current models are pre-release and are therefore subject to change until the a release-candidate has been approved and selected.

Follow for release updates, and please feel free to join in the discussion and effort toward developing a standardized model!
